Title: Package containing functions for ASE analysis using
        Meta-analysis Based Allele-Specific Expression Detection

Description: The package implements MBASED algorithm for detecting
        allele-specific gene expression from RNA count data, where
        allele counts at individual loci (SNVs) are integrated into a
        gene-specific measure of ASE, and utilizes simulations to
        appropriately assess the statistical significance of observed
        ASE.
